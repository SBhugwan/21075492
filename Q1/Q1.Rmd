<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

COVID-19 was a unique time in the wold with basically the whole world going into a lock down.

# Africa 

This section will shows how Africa did compered to other countries.

First i will be looking at the average deaths compared to other regions

```{r Figure1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Average deaths \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

AVD

```

It is clear that the average deaths in Africa seem to be much lower than that to the rest of the world this suggesting that Africa might have been quicker to respond to the infection rates.

This could be because the testing rates in Africa could have been more efficient

```{r Figure2,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Testing rates \\label{Figure2}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}


TP
```

## Healthcare capacity in Africa 

The first will be looking at hospital beds

```{r Figure3,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Hospital Beds \\label{Figure3}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
HB
```

Next i will be looking at ICU patients

```{r Figure4,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "ICU Patients \\label{Figure4}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
HCC
```
