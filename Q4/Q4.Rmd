<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

There are multiple streaming services in the world such as Disney plus, Netflix etc. However Netflix was one of the first streaming services in the world. However the question remains has the market become to saturated given the decline in Netflix users

# Trends Over time

The first thing that i will be looking at is the content on Netflix over time

```{r Figure1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Content on Netflix over time \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

  # This is just a random plot to show you a plot. This is done if the getwd() does not point to your Template's directory.
  # Set WD below to your project's working directory.

print(Trends) 
```

It can be see from this graph that from the late 1990s netflix really starting to take off. However from 2010 there was an explosion in the content. this lasted up an till 2015 as other streaming services started to enter the market.

# Distribution of Content

Given that Netflix is a streaming platform it offers both movies and shows

```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Pie chart of content \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

Pie


```

Is is clearly evident from figure \ref{Figure2} that Netflix offers more movies than shows. To look as this more clearly we will look the bar chart to show the difference in content

```{r Figure3, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bar graph \\label{Figure3}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

Bar
```

It is clearly evident that netflix platform hosts more movies that shows.

However one must question whether given that shows dominate on netflix how do they rate compared to shows.

```{r Figure4, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Average ratings  \\label{Figure4}", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

plot_average_ratings(sorted_ratings)

```

```{r Figure5, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Age Ratings   \\label{Figure4}", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

    print(certification_table)
```

# Popular people on NetflixÂ 

If SU wants to launch its own service it should consider which actors/actress has the most content on netflix

```{r Figure6,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Common Stars on Netflix  \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

plot_top_names(merged_data) 

```

Therefore Shah Rukh Khan has the most content on netflix, thus if SU has its own streaming service it should include some of his content. This is because if we look at the Figure 4.2 we can see that he has a high popularity as well as the content he is in tends to be rated above 6 on IMDb.

```{r Figure7,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Correlation \\label{Figure3}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

plot_popularity("Shah Rukh Khan")

```

# Content By Country

Given that SU will be launching a streaming service in South Africa first and then branch out into the world. Given this it can be seen below that America produces the most content on netflix.

```{r Figure8,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Content Produced by Country \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

plot_title_count_by_country(merged_data)

```

Therefore for SU to be unique it should potential look to produce it own unique content.

What SU could possible do is look as genres that have the most dominate genres

```{r Figure9,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Word cloud most dominate genres \\label{Figure2}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

generate_wordcloud(genre_counts)

```

Therefore it can bee see that drama and comedy are the most popular content on netflix
